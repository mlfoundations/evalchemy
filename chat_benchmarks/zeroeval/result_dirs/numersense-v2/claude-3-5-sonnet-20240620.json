Both numbers have 9 as their whole number part, so we need to compare their decimal parts. The decimal part of 9.9 is 0.9, while the decimal part of 9.11 is 0.11. When comparing decimals, we compare digit by digit from left to right. The first digit after the decimal point for both numbers is 1, so we move to the next digit. 9.9 has no more digits, which is equivalent to having a 0 in that position (9.90), while 9.11 has a 1 in that position. Since 0 is less than 1, 9.9 is smaller than 9.11.\",\n    \"answer\": \"9.9\"\n}\n```"
