# Causal Understanding

This dataset includes a subset of the causal stories in [Nie, Allen, et al. (2024)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/f751c6f8bfb52c60f43942896fe65904-Abstract-Conference.html) and improved examples from [Kıcıman, Emre, et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00050). The first set of questions focuses on testing causal judgment, and the second set focuses on testing the ability to reason about necessary and sufficient causes.
