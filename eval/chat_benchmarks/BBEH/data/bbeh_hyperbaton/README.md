# Hyperbaton

The BBEH Hyperbaton task assesses a model's ability to inductively reason about
adjective order in a novel English variant, where the standard adjective
ordering is randomized. Models must infer this new order from example sentences
with partial orderings and identify correct sentences from provided options.
This task moves beyond testing standard linguistic knowledge, focusing on
inducing and applying new rules, and challenging strong priors about standard
adjective ordering.
