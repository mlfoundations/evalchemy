# BBEH Movie Recommendation

The original Movie Recommendation task in BIG-Bench Hard has been created as
follows. For each question, a set of eight movies from MovieLens have been
selected such that a rather large number of people have all liked five of them
and disliked three of them. Then, a question has been generated by giving four
of the five liked movies and asking models to recommend one of the remaining
four movies, where the correct answer is the one left out of the 5 liked movies.

We updated this task as follows. We create multiple sets of movies where one of
them contains the five liked movies and the other ones contain some of the liked
movies and some of the disliked movies. Then, we ask the model to select the set
that contains movies that are more likely to all be liked by a large group of
people. In the new variant we created, instead of recommending a single movie
given four movies, models have to examine each set separately and predict their
overall likability, and then decide the option that is more likely to have a
likability score with our specific definition of likeability.
