# BBEH SportQA

[SportQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15862) is a challenging sports
understanding dataset designed to test rule-based and strategic reasoning
capabilities in LLMs beyond surface-level sports knowledge. It consists of
three levels (Level 1 to Level 3) with increasing difficulty. In this work, we
focus on Level 3 questions, which are curated by coaches and student athletes
across six sports: soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, table tennis, and
American football. We sub-sample 200 multi-hop reasoning questions and discard
single-hop questions from the Level 3 set. Overall, these questions challenge
LLMs to reason about fine-grained sports rules (e.g., penalty assessment and
tactical choices), which expert student athletes can answer with near-perfect
accuracy. The original data was obtained from
