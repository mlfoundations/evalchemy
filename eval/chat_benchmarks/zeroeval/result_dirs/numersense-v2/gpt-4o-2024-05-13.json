First, we observe the integer part of both numbers, which is 13 for both. Since the integer parts are equal, we then compare the decimal parts. The decimal part of 13.110 is 0.110, and the decimal part of 13.9 is 0.9. Comparing 0.110 and 0.9, we see that 0.9 is larger than 0.110. Therefore, 13.9 is larger than 13.110.\",\n    \"answer\": \"13.9\"\n}\n```"
